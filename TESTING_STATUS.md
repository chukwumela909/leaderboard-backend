# Testing Status Report

## Summary
Testing infrastructure has been set up for the leaderboard backend application with Jest and TypeScript support. While comprehensive test files have been created, several implementation issues need to be resolved.

## Current Status

### ✅ Working Components
- **Jest Configuration**: `jest.config.js` properly configured with TypeScript support
- **Test Environment**: Environment variables and global setup working correctly
- **Basic Tests**: `tests/basic.test.ts` - 15 tests passing ✅
- **Test Scripts**: Package.json updated with comprehensive test commands
- **Coverage Setup**: Jest coverage configuration ready

### ❌ Issues Identified
1. **Service Method Mismatches**: Tests expect instance methods but services use static methods
2. **Socket.IO Import Issues**: `import { io }` syntax not working with Socket.IO client
3. **Cognito Initialization**: JWT verifier fails to initialize in test environment
4. **Environment Dependencies**: Some services require AWS environment setup

## Test Commands Available
```bash
npm test                 # Run all tests
npm run test:watch      # Watch mode
npm run test:coverage   # With coverage report
npm run test:unit       # Unit tests only
npm run test:integration # Integration tests only
npm run test:verbose    # Detailed output
```

## Key Issues to Fix

### 1. Static vs Instance Methods
**Problem**: Tests call `service.method()` but services use `Service.method()`
**Example**: 
```typescript
// Test expects:
const service = new DynamoService();
await service.submitScore(data);

// But actual service uses:
await DynamoService.submitScore(data);
```

### 2. Socket.IO Client Import
**Problem**: `import { io }` fails, Socket.IO client import syntax issue
**Solution**: Use alternative import or update Socket.IO version

### 3. Cognito JWT Verifier
**Problem**: CognitoJwtVerifier requires actual AWS setup
**Solution**: Mock the verifier or skip JWT verification in tests

## Immediate Next Steps

1. **Fix Service Method Calls**: Update all test files to use static method syntax
2. **Resolve Socket.IO Imports**: Fix WebSocket test imports
3. **Mock Cognito Properly**: Ensure JWT verification works in test environment
4. **Gradual Test Enabling**: Fix one test file at a time, starting with services

## Working Example
The `tests/basic.test.ts` file demonstrates that:
- Jest configuration works correctly
- Environment variables are set properly
- Test utilities and matchers function
- Basic validation logic can be tested
- TypeScript compilation works for tests

## Recommended Approach
1. Start with unit tests for individual services
2. Fix static method calls across all test files
3. Implement proper mocking for AWS services
4. Gradually enable integration tests
5. Add end-to-end tests last

## Test Coverage Goals
- **Unit Tests**: All service methods and route handlers
- **Integration Tests**: API endpoints with database
- **WebSocket Tests**: Real-time functionality
- **End-to-End**: Complete user flows

## Dependencies Installed
```json
{
  "jest": "^29.7.0",
  "@types/jest": "^29.5.12",
  "ts-jest": "^29.1.2",
  "supertest": "^7.0.0",
  "@types/supertest": "^6.0.2",
  "socket.io-client": "^4.7.5"
}
```

## Environment Configuration
Tests run with the following environment:
- `DYNAMODB_TABLE=test-leaderboard`
- `AWS_REGION=us-east-1`
- `JWT_SECRET=test-secret-key-for-testing`
- `COGNITO_USER_POOL_ID=us-east-1_testpoolid`
- `COGNITO_CLIENT_ID=test-client-id`

The testing infrastructure is ready and the basic test demonstrates everything works. The next phase requires fixing the service method calls and import issues in the comprehensive test files.
